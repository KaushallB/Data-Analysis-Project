# Movie Analysis and Recommendation System

This is a project on movie analysis and recommendation using a dataset of 1990s movies from Netflix. The project involves analyzing movie data, visualizing insights, and providing movie recommendations based on genre. The project was completed as part of the Data Analysis course on DataCamp, where I learned how to work with real-world datasets and gain valuable insights through Python.

Top Countries: Pie chart showing the top 5 countries with the most movies. Short Action Movies: Identifies and counts action movies shorter than 90 minutes.
